char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
String str = new String(data);
 
Here are some more examples of how strings can be used:

System.out.println("abc");
String cde = "cde";
System.out.println("abc" + cde);
String c = "abc".substring(2,3);
String d = cde.substring(1, 2);
 
The class String includes methods for examining individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings,
for searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a copy of a string with all characters
translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping is based on the Unicode Standard version specified by the Character class.
